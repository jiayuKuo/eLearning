                <p>How often do you actually wash your face? Men tend to have excess oil due to their higher levels of testosterone, so it is important to practice daily cleansing to prevent sebum production. If you live an active lifestyle (ie. workout, hard labour etc), it is essential to remember to cleanse to prevent build up.</p>
                <p> Depending on the severity of your skins oil production, you should try to wash your face at least once a day, but twice daily would be ideal. Men with oilier skin tend to find that they need to cleanse their face twice a day. Using a gel cleanser that targets oily skin would work best or one with activated charcoal ingredients would help with controlling oil production. </p>
                <p>Ensure to use the pads of your fingers to apply the cleanser to a dampened face, lather and rinse off. Use a face towel to pat dry the skin, and make sure not to rub! (Pat! Don’t rub!) </p>

                <!-- video of mac using dry cleanser  -->
                <p>If you suffer from sensitive, tight, cracked, and dehydrated skin, it’s important to ensure you are using the appropriate cleanser to repair and moisturize your face. There are several factors that can affect the condition of the skin, such as environmental and health, so if you live in an area that lacks humidity, you will probably have dry skin.</p>
                <p>Dry skin is caused from excess oil production and water loss, so it is important to remember to stay hydrated and retain moisture. If you live an active lifestyle (i.e., workout, hard labour, etc.), it is essential to remember to cleanse to prevent build up.</p>
                <p>Men with dry skin should try to wash their face with lukewarm water and avoid hot water because it can strip away all the natural oils and further dryness. Depending on how dry your skin is, washing once a day would suffice, however twice daily would be ideal. Washing more than twice a day will put you at risk for excessive dryness. Using a hydrating cream cleanser that targets dry skin would work best, especially one that is fragrance-free and oil-free.</p>
                <p>Ensure to use the pads of your fingers to apply the cleanser to a dampened face, lather and rinse off. Use a face towel to pat dry the skin, and make sure not to rub! (Pat! Don’t rub!)</p>

                <p>You might be asking yourself: what IS normal skin? If you find that your skin feels neither too dry nor too oily, then you have normal skin. Men with normal skin typically do not suffer from sensitive skin issues and have a smooth consistent skin texture.</p>

                <p>Depending on how dry, oily, neither or both, your skin is, you should wash your face at least once a day, but twice daily would be ideal. Using a gel cleanser that hydrates skin while simultaneously locking in moisture would work best for normal skin.</p>

                    <p>Moisturizing your freshly cleansed face should be the second step in your skin care routine. </p>
                    <p>Another question you might be asking yourself is: what’s the difference between moisturizer and lotion? There are a few key differences between the two. A moisturizer is a type of cream made specifically for the face, whereas lotions are a type of moisturizer made to hydrate the body. Since lotions are meant for the body, they are typically not as thick as face creams to allow for easy spread and absorption. There are certain ingredients that lotions have to appropriately hydrate the thicker skin of the body, such as oils, whereas moisturizers have ingredients tailored to the needs of the skin of the face (dryness, sensitivity, etc.). </p>
                    <p>Moisturizer is an essential step of a skin care routine. It aids with promoting healthy and youthful looking skin. Different skin types require different moisturizers. As with cleansers, there are several factors that can affect the condition of the skin, such as environmental and health. If you live in a dry area, you may suffer from dry skin and if you live in a humid area, you may suffer from oily skin.</p>
                    <p>Continue below to see which kind of moisturizer would work best for your skin type and how to apply it!</p>

                    <h3>Oily</h3> <!-- ponds-->

                    <p>Men with oily skin should try to avoid moisturizers with oil as a main ingredient. Since the skin already produces an excess amount of oil, you don’t want to add onto that by using heavy, oily creams to moisturize. Using a lightweight, non-greasy, gel-based moisturizer would work best for this skin type. </p>
                    <p> Ensure to use the pads of your fingers to apply a dab of moisturizer to your freshly cleansed forehead, chin, and either cheek. Use your fingertips to evenly spread the product across your face and let dry.</p>

                    <h3>Dry</h3> <!-- cetaphil-->

                    <p>Men with dry skin should use cream-based moisturizers that have oil and water as key ingredients. Water-based ingredients help with drawing in moisture while oil-based ingredients aid with retaining that moisture. Cream-based moisturizers are typically quite thick, so they feel heavier on the surface of the skin and take longer to dry.</p>

                    <p>The climate has a huge impact on the state of your skin. Skin tends to be at its driest during the winter season, as humidity and temperature levels drop, and cold winds rise. It’s important to practice extra care during those cold months.</p>

                    <h3>Normal</h3>

                    <p>Men with normal skin can use any type of moisturizer. Depending on if your skin is more on the dry side, you might want to use a thicker face cream. If it’s more on the oily side, you might want to use a non-greasy, gel-based moisturizer. </p>
