                <p>How often do you actually wash your face? Men tend to have excess oil due to their higher levels of testosterone, so it is important to practice daily cleansing to prevent sebum production. If you live an active lifestyle (ie. workout, hard labour etc), it is essential to remember to cleanse to prevent build up.</p>
                <p> Depending on the severity of your skins oil production, you should try to wash your face at least once a day, but twice daily would be ideal. Men with oilier skin tend to find that they need to cleanse their face twice a day. Using a gel cleanser that targets oily skin would work best or one with activated charcoal ingredients would help with controlling oil production. Ensure to use the pads of your fingers to apply the cleanser to a dampened face, lather and rinse off. Use a face towel to pat dry the skin, and make sure not to rub! (Pat! Don’t rub!) </p>

                <!-- video of mac using dry cleanser  -->
                <p>If you suffer from sensitive, tight, cracked, and dehydrated skin, it’s important to ensure you are using the appropriate cleanser to repair and moisturize your face. There are several factors that can affect the condition of the skin, such as environmental and health, so if you live in an area that lacks humidity, you will probably have dry skin.  </p>
                <p>Dry skin is caused from excess oil production and water loss, so it is important to remember to stay hydrated and retain moisture. If you live an active lifestyle (i.e., workout, hard labour, etc.), it is essential to remember to cleanse to prevent build up.  </p>
                <p>Men with dry skin should try to wash their face with lukewarm water and avoid hot water because it can strip away all the natural oils and further dryness. Depending on how dry your skin is, washing once a day would suffice, however twice daily would be ideal. Washing more than twice a day will put you at risk for excessive dryness. Using a hydrating cream cleanser that targets dry skin would work best, especially one that is fragrance-free and oil-free.  </p>
                <p>Ensure to use the pads of your fingers to apply the cleanser to a dampened face, lather and rinse off. Use a face towel to pat dry the skin, and make sure not to rub! (Pat! Don’t rub!) </p>

        <!-- video of mac using normal cleanser  -->
                <p>You might be asking yourself: what IS normal skin? If you find that your skin feels neither too dry nor too oily, then you have normal skin. Men with normal skin typically do not suffer from sensitive skin issues and have a smooth consistent skin texture.</p>
                <p>If you live an active lifestyle (i.e.. workout, hard labour etc.), it is essential to remember to cleanse to prevent build up.  </p>
                <p>Depending on how dry, oily, neither or both, your skin is, you should wash your face at least once a day, but twice daily would be ideal. Using a gel cleanser that hydrates skin while simultaneously locking in moisture would work best for normal skin.</p>
